- **Creating a Pie Chart Using Datawrapper**
  -   On its [homepage](https://www.datawrapper.de/), click to "Create a chart"
  -   On the right top corner, you will find "New Chart"
  -   Then, you see four steps of creating a chart: Upload Data, Check & Describe, Visualize, and Publish & Embed
    1.  Upload Data
        * You can copy & paste data table directly in the blank box;
        * Upload XLS or CSV files;
        * Import Google Spreadsheet by copying & pasting the link; or
        * Link to other external datasets.
        * **For our practice, we will use [Lehigh Enrollment data](https://oirsa.lehigh.edu/fte-headcount) from the Office of Institutional Research. I have put part of the Spring 2020 and Fall 2020 Undergraduate Enrollment data into this [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dFnkn8Sm_aJHxFLC6DD8W4mIthVDjTIz6A0h-_kE2lA/edit?usp=sharing). To create a chart, you can copy and paste the data into the box, or choose to import data directly from this Google Spreadsheet.**
        * If you copy & paste the data, make sure you select the portion of the dataset correctly
        * Read more about [the different ways of uploading data into Datawrapper](https://academy.datawrapper.de/article/86-upload-data)
        * Once the data is correctly imported or added, hit "Proceed"
    2. Check & Describe
        * Check if your first row of data are labels
        * Sort the data if you want to make them show in a certain order (e.g., list data in descending order by the "Total" column)
        * Sometimes, you may need to transpose (swap rows and columns), add a column, etc.
        * The data shown on your screen are also editable, which is very convenient.
    3. Visualize
        * Start with choosing the **chart type**. In this practice, we want to create a pie chart. You will see multiple pie charts created using the four columns of data in the Google Spreadsheet.
        * You can insert a title by typing into the text box. You can name it "Lehigh Enrollment 2017."
        * You can also change the chart size, either by directly typing in the length and the width, or by choosing the device on which your chart will be viewed.
        * The interface also allows you to do a colorblind check.
        * Next, we go to the "**Refine**" tab. Here, you can customize the colors of your chart.
        * Under the same tab, you can also choose how many slices you want to show in your pie chart. Sometimes, the data has too many categories, and you may want to group some of the least important into this "other" category--the system can do that automatically for you. But in case you want to show all of them, or specify a number of slides that are visible, you can manually change that number here.
        * Then, you get to **Annotate** your chart. This is critical for enabling user understanding of the chart.
        * You will be able to add a title ("Lehigh Undergraduate Enrollment Spring 2020"), a description ("This pie chart shows the undergraduate enrollment in the colleges and programs at Lehigh University in Spring 2020. College of Arts & Sciences has the largest enrollment, with a total of 1830 students."), a note (optional), data source ("Office of Institutional Research"), link to data source (https://oirsa.lehigh.edu/enrollment), byline (you can put your name down as the author)
        * In case you want your readers to concentrate on one part of the data, you can choose to highlight the element(s) as well.
        * Finally, we can take a final look at the **Design** of the chart, deciding the layout, output locale, and whether or not to enable social sharing.
    4. Publish & Embed
        * Lastly, of course, is to publish your beautiful chart. With the free account, you get to get the embed code, which you will use to publish the chart on your io page. With a paid account, you also have the option to save your chart locally as an image or PDF.
        * Once you click to publish your chart, it will give you a URL, which you can use for sharing, and an emded code, as an iframe, which you can use to insert into your io page.

- **Embedding your chart on GitHub.io page**
  -   Super simple: you will need to copy and paste the embed code from the Datawrapper website to your ReadMe file on GitHub.com
  -   You will not see the chart showing up on your ReadMe file. The iframe is an interactive feature, which will show up on your GitHub.io page (note the difference). 
  -   You may still don't see your chart on your io page just instantly. It is just because it needs time updating and loading the changes, especially for an interactive feature such as this iframe. Give it a couple of minutes; keep refreshing the page; be patient!
  -   Don't forget to *always* add a project title and a description. It is also good practice to note the tool you used to create the chart, the data source you used, a link to the dataset, etc.
  -   To see what a chart looks like when embedded on GitHub.io, please see examples on my [io page](https://haiyanjia-lehigh.github.io/).


- **Creating a bar or column chart**
  -   Now that you are familiar with the process through which you can create a chart on Datawrapper, you can easily create other types of charts!
  -   Let's try to create a bar chart using the same data. You will go directly to Step 3 Visualize; this time, under Chart Type tab, choose a bar chart to visualize your data.
  -   Refine: The Values we want to visualize is "Total." Sort the values by "largest first." Consider the labeling options and alignments. Then, you have the same old color customization, chart size, etc., to choose from.
  -   Annotate: Don't forget to correctly annotate your chart as before!
  -   Then, you are ready to publish your new chart! Add it to your io page using the embed code.
  

- **Explore Datawrapper**
  -   Datawrapper provides sample datasets for various chart types. Go create a new chart, and in the first step, where you can upload your own data, try one of the sample datasets from Datawrapper.
  -   Of course, you can search online and find a dataset that is interesting to you. Again, you may need to clean up the data before you upload it to Datawrapper. You can also copy and paste the portion that you want to investigate. You can also make the dataset into a Google Spreadsheet.
  -   When you link your own Google Spreadsheet to Datawrapper, **make sure you change the sharing settings of your Google Spreadsheet to "anyone who has the link can view"**
