## Telling Stories to Show Change over Time & Relationships

- **How to Use Datawrapper**
  -   Check out our [Introduction to Datawrapper](https://github.com/HaiyanJia-Lehigh/DataStorytelling/blob/master/Telling%20Stories%20to%20Show%20Composition%20%26%20Comparison.md) if you need a refresher.
  -   Questions? Consult their [FAQ page](https://www.datawrapper.de/faq/) and [How-to page](https://academy.datawrapper.de/).

- **Creating a line chart using Datawrapper**
  -   Here are some [articles from the Datawrapper staff on creating line charts](https://academy.datawrapper.de/category/76-line-charts)
  -   As a starting point, let's see [What to consider when creating line charts](https://academy.datawrapper.de/article/129-what-to-consider-when-creating-line-charts), and then learn [How to create a line chart](https://academy.datawrapper.de/article/23-how-to-create-a-line-chart) and how to [customize the line chart](https://academy.datawrapper.de/article/47-customizing-your-line-chart)
  -   For our practice project, we want to address the question:
  **What are the percentages of students in each of Lehigh's three undergraduate colleges over the past ten years?**
  -   Find the data for ten years of [Lehigh's institutional profile](https://oirsa.lehigh.edu/fte-headcount). You will be using the html version that has more than ten years of Lehigh profiles in tabs at the bottom.
  -   Create a spreadsheet in Google docs that has four columns: Year, Arts & Sciences, Business and Engineering.
  -   Only collect the data for Arts & Sciences, Business and Engineering for the past ten years and enter it into a spreadsheet in Google Docs. This will take about 5-10 minutes.
  -   Link that Google spreadsheet to Datawrapper, and create a line graph/time-series chart that shows the changes in percentage of undergraduate enrollment per college per year.
  -   Embed that line chart to your io page.
  
- **Creating other chart types using Datawrapper**
  -   Let's use the sample data in Datawrapper to create an area chart, a stacked chart, and scattor plot. 
  -   Check out Datawrapper's instructions on [area charts](https://academy.datawrapper.de/category/78-area-chart),
  -   [Stacked column charts](https://academy.datawrapper.de/category/75-column-charts), and
  -   [Scattor plots](https://academy.datawrapper.de/category/79-scatterplots)

## Project Assignment
 -  Please find a dataset that is of interest to you to create a chart using what we have learned (i.e. pie chart, bar chart, colunm chart, line chart, area chart, stacked chart, or scattor plot)
 -  Publish your chart on your io page, and copy and paste the url on Course Site using the submission link
 -  Not sure where to find data? Here are [some starters on how to find usable datasets](https://github.com/HaiyanJia-Lehigh/DataVisualization/blob/master/Finding%20Data.md)! Also, check out the new [Google Dataset Search](https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch) tool.
